    <h1> Hello World!</h1>
      <h2> A place I would like to visit. </h2>
    <p> If I could visit anywhere in the world, I would go to the Bahamas. I absolutely love the beach and I have heard that it is amazing. 
      It makes me super happy when the water is so bright, you can see each shade of blue as it groes from lighter to darker. </p>
      <h2> A person I admire.</h2>
    <p> A person I admire is Rosa Parks. I definitely admire her because of her strength and courage. She stood up for what she 
      believed in and went through with it. </p>
